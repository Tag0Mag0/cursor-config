When performing any tasks or analysis that requires the current date and time:
1. ALWAYS use the system time server by running the `date` command to get the accurate current time
2. DO NOT rely on assumptions or static date information
3. Use this time information for:
   - Timestamp-based operations
   - Date calculations
   - Time-sensitive analysis
   - Log entries
   - Any other time-dependent tasks
4. Format the date and time appropriately for the specific use case
5. Consider timezone information when relevant to the task
