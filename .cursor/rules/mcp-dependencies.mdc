Rule Name: mcp-dependencies
Description: 
This project requires specific dependencies for MCP servers to function:

1. Node.js with npx must be installed
2. uv package manager must be installed (provides uvx)

Before running any MCP-related commands:
- Verify these dependencies are installed
- Direct users to .cursor/README.md for setup instructions
- If dependencies are missing, pause and help user install them

The setup script at .cursor/setup_deps.sh can automatically install these dependencies.
